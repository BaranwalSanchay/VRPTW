<b>
A take on Modified Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and its applications on Logistics, Supply Chain and the Indian Railways.
</b>
<hr><br><h3>Abstract</h3>
The project looks at the attempt to present an optimized method of freight transportation over a large scale. Several assumptions have been made which are enlisted in the contents of the repository. The mathematical formulation is provided, and the code has been executed through the IBM CPLEX Solver. The implementation of Modified-Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (MVRP-TW) methodology in optimizing freight transportation routes within Indian Railways. Through strategic planning and algorithmic application, this approach orchestrates the movement of multiple vehicles to serve customers efficiently while adhering to time constraints and optimizing route efficiency. The mathematical model has been thoroughly discussed along with the assumptions and notations used. The report mentions the references and code snippets towards the end for the viewersâ€™ reference.
