<h2>Introduction</h2>
Indian Railways, a vast railway network, faces significant hurdles in optimizing transportation operations, particularly in route and schedule management for efficient goods delivery. This project delves into solving the Modified Vehicle Routing Problem (MVRP), customized for Indian Railways' freight logistics, with a key modification reflecting real-life railway scenarios. 
<br>
<br>
Traditionally, in vehicle routing problems, the input and output nodes are typically the same. However, to better mimic real-world railway operations, we've introduced a distinction between the initial depot, where goods are loaded onto trains, and the final depot, where trains conclude their service after completing deliveries across the network. This adjustment mirrors the operational reality of railways, enhancing the problem's relevance to freight logistics.
<br>
<br>
Leveraging IBM CPLEX Solver, we've implemented an algorithm to tackle this intricate problem within Indian Railways' expansive network.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
For Indian Railways' freight operations, we address the Modified Vehicle Routing Problem (MVRP) to optimize freight transportation. The task involves visiting n + 2 nodes: the first and last nodes represent the initial and final depots, respectively, while the other n nodes are delivery destinations with specific demands and time windows
<br>
<br>
Each delivery destination requires a certain quantity of goods and specifies a preferable time window for delivery. Importantly, each station should be visited by only one train to meet its demand adequately.
<br>
<br>
Our objective is to devise an efficient routing and scheduling strategy for freight trains, ensuring timely delivery of goods and minimizing transportation costs. Through algorithmic solutions tailored to these constraints, we aim to enhance the efficiency of Indian Railways' freight logistics management.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To access the codes of the project and run with other datasets, install IBM CPLEX, login, and open the files as a new OPL project.

<h2>Procedure and Result</h2>
In this project, optimization techniques with CPLEX Optimizer were utilized to increase the efficiency and plan optimized routes for transport. Through the use of CPLEX, the most efficient solution was determined, resulting in reduced delays for the given data.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, the application of Modified-Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (MVRP-TW) methodology for optimizing freight transportation routes signifies a significant advancement in enhancing efficiency and effectiveness within our logistics operations.
Through strategic planning and implementation of MVRP-TW algorithms, we have successfully orchestrated the movement of multiple vehicles to serve our customers while adhering to time constraints and optimizing route efficiency.
<br>
<br>
This optimization endeavour has yielded substantial benefits, including minimized travel times and improved overall operational performance. By efficiently allocating resources and optimizing routes for multiple vehicles, we have streamlined our logistics processes, ensuring timely deliveries and enhancing customer satisfaction. In summary, the optimization of freight transportation routes using MVRP-TW represents a strategic investment in any company's future, ensuring that they remain agile, efficient, and sustainable in a rapidly evolving marketplace.
